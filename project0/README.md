-This project is a little simple. It is about the creation of a html page connected with other html pages. 

There is a folder called static where I save all the imagenes that I used in the differents html files.

Index.html is the principal page of my personal website. Here, It displays information about myself. Then, there are links to connect with other pages: 

    ---the first one is hometown: It dosplays information about the city where I am born.
    ---The second one is music.html. Here you can find my opinion about music a links to spotify that let you know about my favorite music. 
    --sport.html show you my favorite sport: The F1. Here, I put some information about the principals scuderias.
    --Fanally, socialnetworks.html show links to my personal networks.

In addition, there is a style.css file which let me add a personal style to the html fyles. It is based on style.scss

Thank you for read me!
